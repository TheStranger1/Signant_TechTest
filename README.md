# Signant_TechTest
This repository contains tasks from Signant Technical Assessment.

##  UI Automation:
In the UI Automation part the following things were tested:
  1. New User Registration Process
  2. Login functionality works for the Registered users
  3. Reviewing User Information

### Tools used:
  1. Framework: Robot Framework
  2. Library:   Selenium Library
  3. Python: Python 3.7
  4. IDE: PyCharm

### Design Pattern:
I've used Page OBject Model (POM) for the UI automation so that it reduces code duplication and improves test maintenance. Also, it makes the code cleaner and easy to understand.

##  API Automation:
In the API Automation the following things were tested:
  1. Fetching user data
  2. Reviewing user information
  3. Updating user information
 
 ###  Tools used:

## Answers for the questions regarding Testing and Testability were also added to this repository

### Questions that were answered:
  1. How do you review code? 
  2. How do you enforce coding standards? 
  3. How do you plan what kind of approach you take for test automation - what libraries to use, how does it work in couple of years, how to make it easy to maintain, etc?        What are the main points to consider? 
  4. Code testability, how do you enforce it? 
  5. How do you make sure that the product is testable?
